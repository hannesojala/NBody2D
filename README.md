# NBody2D
A (very underdeveloped) 2D N body gravity simulation in C++ using SDL2.

# Usage
Compile with usual flags for optimzation, yada yada.
Make sure your environment is set up to find SDL.h, link properly, and find SDL2.so/SDL2.dll and stuff.
Help on that here: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php

Example compile: g++ -o NBody2D -I ./include src/*.cpp -O3 -lSDL2
